      <h1>How does it work?</h1>
      <p>
        You schedule an interview.
        You pitch, we ask. Then, we discuss.
        Then, we either give you a check or explain
        why not.
        We video record the entire session and
        publish it online. You will have to sign this
        <a href="consent.html">consent</a> before we start talking.
      </p>
      <p>
        We don't care what you do with the money.
        We don't sit on your board and we don't control you anyhow.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may come back to us for more money,
        in a month, not earlier. Also, if we reject you,
        don't hesitate to come back in a month.
      </p>
      <h1>Can we skip the video?</h1>
      <p>
        Nope. Video is an important part of our business model
        and marketing strategy. We're not only giving you money,
        but also trying to teach everybody else.
      </p>
      <p>
        If your startup is doing something secret and you don't
        want to disclose the idea, don't. We don't really care
        about the idea. We care about you and your ability
        to implement something.
